# ScorchVision

**ScorchVision** is an open-source mobile app (available on the App Store) for configuring and monitoring a Raspberry Pi-based fire detection system. The system uses computer vision to detect fire through a camera and senses smoke and gas with an MQ2 sensor. ScorchVision provides an intuitive interface for setting thresholds, receiving alerts, and monitoring the detection system.
